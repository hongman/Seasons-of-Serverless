# Challenge 2: Lovely Ladoos

## Your Chefs: Soumya Narapaju, Microsoft Student Ambassador

## This week's featured region: India

It's Diwali season in India! Diwali is the celebration of a goddess Durga killing a demon, it is a symbol for women empowerment in India that is celebrated across the country. Families celebrate with fireworks and light up every house in the country with diwas, a type of Indian candles. A very popular delicacy that Indians eat during Diwali is Ladoos.

Ladoos a ball of besan flour dipped in sugar syrup. Since we're in the middle of a global pandemic most of the celebrations have to be done from home and we have to be innovative to find our inner child to have fun during Diwali 2020, but thanks to technology we're still connected to our loved ones virtually!
 
Your challenge: create an AI computer vision API from Cognitive Services as a component to a blob storage that has pictures of ladoos made on Diwali. This way, folks can query upload an image of their ladoos and see how accurate a model can be created to identify your ladoos. You'll need a dataset of ladoos, and we've added some in [this folder](/graphics/ladoo-dataset). In simple words, your ladoo model will serve as a judge to your skill in making ladoos. This is a playful way to channel your inner child for Diwali!
