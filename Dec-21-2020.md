As garae-tteok has long and cylindrical shape, people wish to live long, by eating tteok-guk. When cooking tteok-guk starts, the garae-tteok is sliced into small pieces, which look like coins. This coin-like shape also brings people believes to be financially wealthy.

### Ingredients (for 4 people)

* Garae-tteok: 400g
* Diced beef: 100g
* Water: 10 cups
* Eggs: 2
* Spring onion: 1
* Minced garlic: 1 tbsp
* Soy sauce: 2 tbsp
* Sesame oil: 1 tbsp
* Olive oil: 1 tbsp
* Salt and pepper

### Recipe

1. Slice garae-ttok into small pieces &ndash; no thicker than 5 mm.
   * You can buy sliced garae-tteok.
   * But in this case, put the sliced garae-tteok into a bowl of water for about 30 mins.
2. Slice spring onion.
3. At high heat, stir-fry the diced beef with sesame oil and olive oil until the beef surface goes brown.
4. Put the water into the wok and boil for about 30 mins with medium heat.
5. While boiling, remove bubbles from the water from time to time.
6. Get the eggs beaten.
7. After the 30 mins, put the minced garlic and soy sauce into the boiled soup. Add some salt, if necessary.
8. Add the beaten egg and sliced spring onion.
9. Serve the soup with pepper drizzled on top.

We want to automate the whole step. When we enter a number of people, the whole amount of ingredients should be automatically calculated. If you buy the sliced garae-tteok, you should wait for 30 mins for macerating. Make sure that the stir-fried beef goes brown in 8 mins but it may take longer than that!
