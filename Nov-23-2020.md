# Challenge 1: The Perfect Holiday Turkey

## Your Chefs: Jen Looper, Cloud Advocate (Microsoft) and Darren Butler, Microsoft Student Ambassador

## This week's challenge:

In North America, the holidays are simply not complete without a proper turkey on the table! The only problem is, these birds can be hard to cook so that they are not dry and tough. The secret? A proper brine! 

There's a science to a great turkey brine, but we, as software engineers, are both absent-minded and need an automated way to remind ourselves each year of the proper percentages of ingredients of a good brine, based on the weight of the turkey.

Your challenge: convert the brine equation to an automated process so that when you input a turkey's weight, you will be given the amount of water, sugar, salt, and spices to add. 

Let's assume you have a ten gallon cooler for your turkey and that it's defrosted.
